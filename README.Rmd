1. Shiny: can be installed from CRAN

2. [videoplayR](http://rpubs.com/sjmgarnier/videoplayR)

System requirements:

2. R(v3.3.2). Earlier versions may work


## Features

The features within this package allow for a self-contained workflow of grain size extraction, data sieving, descriptive statistics and probability distribution fitting. An example workflow would be:
